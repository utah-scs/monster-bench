# 5/22/23

- Ankit Q: Trees might make more sense since data deps amp differences in memory latency
- TODOs for CI/experiment runner
 - Rework CI to put runner in /proj so new runners work even after more than 1 hour
 - Script to run client/server and collect results
- Need to decide how toml files are structured
- Ashfaq: trying to run it, but not getting responses back from server
 - Ankit: probably because not using the client hw mac address
- TODOs on running experiments
 - Swap TOML args on client/server so that can run/configure them from commandline
 - Create run.py that can run client/server (across SSH where needed)
