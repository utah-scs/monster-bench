### Benchmarks ###

* All ycsb benchmarks including the latest one.

### Design ###

* Hash table design can be in two parts: Shared hash map and thead local hash map
* Or One big hash table interface which will include both shared hashmap and local hashmap
* Experiment  with different memory placement policies (CREW, EREW, CRCW).
Details of placement policies can be found in MICA paper.
* One queue pair per NUMA node for shared memory.
* Allocation: NIC receives the packets, DMA to local memory and then copied to shared memory.
* New writes will always be in local memory.
* After first write when the key will be read it will be moved to shared memory.
* Look up will be in parallel in both shared and local memory.

### Questions ###
* What will be the design of shared memory allocator?
* How core X will deallocate core Yâ€™s memory?
