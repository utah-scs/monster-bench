### Baselines ###

#### Client assisted request routing (EREW) ####

* Keys will be partitioned statically and optimally.
* Clients will be responsible for sending request to the correct server/core.
* Cores only access local memory.
* Needs reconfiguration of partitions and migration of data if skew changes.
* Clients need to be informed on reconfiguration.
* Approximate processing time per request: 200 ns for hash table access on local memory + 1400 cycles for DPDK packet processing.

#### Server assisted request routing (shared only) ####

* Full Hashtable lives in shared memory.
* Client oblivious routing. Clients can send requests to any server.
* Assumes no key partitioning.
* Skew resistance. No reconfiguration and data migration.
* Approximate processing time per request: 400ns for hash table access on remote memory + 1400 cycles for DPDP packet processing.

#### Discussion ####

* Client assisted routing is only marginally better than server assisted shared only model.
* In both cases assumes no memory latency hiding techniques. (e.g: Pipelined memory access)
